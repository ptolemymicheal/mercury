sourcecode for portfolio/ first website
                                 Q4 2022/Q1 2023 entry
This file was initially a playground for trying out html and css tags as i learnt them, it eventually became the first site i scripted, i have decided to leave those first of tags i wrote to make something for the very first time (legacy index.html & legacy style.css)
The general idea is to overhaul or at least make major changes once every year as i learn new things
Still undecided if i will introduce new technologies with each overhaul, but in general HTML and vanilla CSS/JS should  be the main tools
In the past year, react was the only major thing i picked up, i still haven't perfected it would honestly be an overkill for something of this small scale
